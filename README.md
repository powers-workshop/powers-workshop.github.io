## About the Workshop

There is a long-standing view according to which potency precedes actuality. Under this view, the happening of an event consists in the realization or manifestation of potentialities that already exist in the event’s participants. Indeed, the world seems full of entities that encapsulate such potentialities, which we usually refer to as realizable entities, with dispositions being among the most significant. A disposition is an entity that inheres in another entity and determines the behavior of the latter under certain circumstances. Dispositions are closely related to the causal powers that objects have in the world and encompass what we usually call abilities, capabilities, tendencies, propensities, liabilities, capacities, and so on.

As they link the static structure of the world (i.e., the endurants/continuants that populate it) to its dynamical structure (i.e., the perdurants/occurrents that can happen to or be performed by such continuants), realizable entities have become a popular topic in the Formal Ontology community, being subject of active research. Among other applications, realizable entities have been employed to represent diseases and biological functions, provide ontological grounds for risks and probabilities, model engineered artifacts and affordances, and describe organizational capabilities and social roles.

The purpose of POWERs is to turn the spotlight on this issue, providing a venue for researchers and practitioners to present their work on dispositions and other realizable entities, exploring their various perspectives. Information and computer scientists, philosophers, cognitive scientists, linguists, conceptual modelers, domain experts, and professionals from related disciplines are very welcome to participate.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

* **Formalization and Characterization**

  - Formal models and logics for realizable entities (e.g., single- vs. multi-track dispositions, degrees of realization, disposition-based reasoning)

  - Connections between realizable entities and other ontological categories (e.g., qualities, events)

* **Types and Categories**

  - Distinction between dispositional and non-dispositional realizable entities

  - Status of core entities (e.g., roles, biological/artifactual functions) as realizable entities or not

* **Applications**

  - Domain-specific uses in biology, health sciences, industry, enterprise modeling, and beyond.

* **Philosophical Foundations**

  - The metaphysical vs. linguistic nature of the distinction between realizable and non-realizable (“categorical”) properties

  - Intrinsicness and extrinsicness of realizable entities

  - The relevance of the disposition/power distinction for formal ontology

  - Dispositions in accounts of causation

  - The role of blocks, finks, and antidotes in applied ontology

  - Dispositions as substitutes for laws of nature in ontology
